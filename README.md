A simple <strong>SPA</strong> built with <i>React</i> and <i>Tailwind CSS</i>. 

The application consents to visualize the projects made by Beelab Laboratory, a company that build mainly-wooden objects and restores vintage furniture. The pages offer a brief description of the company and the projects, and a list of contacts to get in touch with the company.
